# CS50P
**A collection of my solutions for CS50â€™s Python programming problem sets.**

Welcome to my repository for CS50â€™s Introduction to Programming with Python! ðŸŽ‰
This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets from Harvard Universityâ€™s CS50: Introduction to Programming with Python. The course provides a comprehensive introduction to computer science and programming, focusing on Python's versatility and practical applications.

 <h2>About the Course</h2>
CS50P is an entry-level course that explores key programming concepts, including:
-Data types, variables, and expressions
-Control flow with conditionals and loops
-Functions and modular programming
-Data structures such as lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples
-File handling and regular expressions
-Object-oriented programming principles

This repository serves as a record of my progress, demonstrating problem-solving techniques and foundational coding skills essential for further exploration in computer science.
